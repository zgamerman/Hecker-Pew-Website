    <section id='aboutUs' class='subDivide finalSub'>
      <p>Renamed from Hecker PLLC in May of 2019, our firm is consistently recognized as a Best Law Firm and our partners recognized as Best Lawyers by US News and World Report.  Attorneys at Hecker Pew have helped the founders, the leaders, and the visionaries of hundreds of businesses, organizing and incorporating limited liability companies, corporations, and other entities, not only here in Arizona but in jurisdictions from California to Delaware.  We frequently represent clients from inception as small limited liability companies or closely-held corporations, through “series seed” and subsequent early-stage financing rounds, to multi-million dollar mergers and acquisitions.  We take pride in intimately understanding clients’ businesses, strategies, and goals and are equally at home working with a client starting a business out of a garage to sitting across the table from attorneys at some of the world’s largest law firms negotiating complex transactions.</p>
      <p>We have demonstrated expertise in the negotiation and preparation of complex corporate documents including Purchase and Sales Agreements in connection with merger and acquisition transactions, Operating Agreements, Shareholder Agreements, and related documents for entities engaged in Technology, Healthcare, Biotechnology, General Business, and Real Estate.  We also regularly provide services such as the preparation, filing, and publication of entity organizational documents.  Lawyers at Hecker Pew work together closely and bring diverse strengths, interests, and experiences.  Our integrated approach to legal practice means that our attorneys work closely with one another to ensure that the strengths of each are brought to bear on every legal issue we handle.  In 2017, attorneys at Hecker Pew represented the seller in a transaction that was awarded the 2017 Deal of the Year Award by the Association for Corporate Growth-Arizona Chapter.</p>
      <p>Attorneys at Hecker Pew are committed to the community and work with various non-profits in Southern Arizona, in addition to remaining heavily involved at the University of Arizona College of Law, teaching and mentoring students.</p>
